Bacterial growth is modeled using continued fraction of straight lines. doi: [10.1101/2025.01.27.634991](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.27.634991)

The data (bactgrowth.txt) can be found [here](https://github.com/tpetzoldt/growthrates/tree/master/data)

The code and estimations for models $N,N^{II},N^{III}$ and $N^{IV}$ are provided.

Alternatively, one can also use the a-m-kinetics repository to model bacterial growth.
